HTML version is 5
according to html.spec.whatwg.org and w3.org I found tags potentially cotaining file references
all other sources were very incorrect

obsolete
archive <applet archive=url1,url2,url3> <object archive="url1 url2 url3"> => tag applet is obsolete and archive on <object> is not in HTML5
background <body> => not in HTML5
classid <object> => not in HTML5
code => not in HTML5
codebase => not in HTML5
icon => not in HTML5
longdesc => not in HTML5
profile => not in HTML5
usemap <img; object> => not longer URI

standart HTML, but URL not a file
itemid <HTML elements> Valid URL potentially surrounded by spaces => in fact URI is valid
itemprop <HTML elements> Unordered set of unique space-separated tokens, case-sensitive, consisting of valid absolute URLs, defined property names, or text*
itemtype <HTML elements> Unordered set of unique space-separated tokens, case-sensitive, consisting of valid absolute URL*
ping <a; area> Set of space-separated tokens consisting of valid non-empty URLs

standart HTML
action <form> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
cite <blockquote; del; ins; q> Valid URL potentially surrounded by spaces
data <object> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
formaction <button; input> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
href <a; area; base> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
href <link> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
manifest <html> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
poster <video> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
src <audio; embed; iframe; img; input; script; source; track; video> Valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces
srcset="url1 resolution1, url2 resolution2" <img; source> Comma-separated list of image candidate strings

standart CSS contained in HTML
style="property: url(<filename>) property: url(<filename>)" <HTML elements>
