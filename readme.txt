file_scraper.out is the executable. 
My notes are in notes.txt. 

There are 2 classes making interfaces usable in some other program: 
response_getter and parser and there should be actually 3, the last downloader, 
but I am sending it like that, because following days I will not have time to finish it next 30 hours. 

My research where to search for files referenced from HTML is in places_with_references_in _html.txt. 
Despite receiving following Links in HTTP header, the assignment is clear in downloading only "files the page references" 
and from Wikipedia: "The web page usually means what is visible, but the term may also refer to a computer file, usually written in HTML or a comparable markup language." 
so information from protocol does not qualify.

I really want to make the program better, but I think I will be too late after that, this is surely my biggest homework.
